# JUNIOR JOBS

## PROJECT BRIEF

Interactive Full-Stack Project
Projects play a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you enter the last phase of the boot camp, you’ll begin to apply for development jobs. If you want to land interviews, your portfolio must feature high-quality deployed examples of your work—and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

As your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, this particular project will be a focal point of your portfolio. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. That’s why one of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project we decided to do was a job portal for graduates to be able to get connected to jobs with a specific entry level requirement where there can be coaching and defined scope for the graduate to learn as they go and build up confidence and skill in the industry.
